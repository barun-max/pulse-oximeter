# Lab Log – Pulse Oximeter

## 2026-01-28
- Decided to use GitHub for documentation
- Feeling less intimidated
- Goal: learn PCB design properly

## Questions
- How does MAX30102 multiplex LEDs?
- How sensitive is it to power noise?

Day 1:
- MAX30102 integrates LEDs, PD, ADC
- LED current pulses can introduce noise
- Sensor communicates over I2C
