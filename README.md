# Pulse Oximeter Project

## Why this project
I want to understand how pulse rate and SpO2 are measured at the hardware and signal level,
not just by using libraries.

## What I’m building
A pulse oximeter using the MAX30102 sensor and a microcontroller,
with focus on low-noise PCB design.

## Current status
Learning PCB design and studying the MAX30102 datasheet.

## Next steps
- Finalize block diagram
- Start schematic design
